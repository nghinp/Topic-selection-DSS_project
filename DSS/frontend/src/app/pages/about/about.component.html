            This decision support system is designed to assist students in choosing and refining thesis topics through a
            structured, data-driven approach. It combines a research-based questionnaire, keyword-matching logic, and
            transparent scoring to identify thesis directions that align with your interests, skills, and working style.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system evaluates several dimensions—including thesis type preference, preferred working style, interest
            area identification, and skill self-assessment. Each contributes to a personalized recommendation list,
            helping you understand why certain topics or fields may be a stronger fit. Our goal is to make the selection
            process clearer, faster, and more confidence-building for every student.
          </p>
          <p>
            With an emphasis on accessibility and privacy, your responses are processed locally or securely on the server
            without unnecessary data collection. The platform supports reflection, planning, and better communication
            with supervisors by providing actionable insights that guide your thesis journey.
